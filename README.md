The code creates a single-page airline website featuring a header, hero section, about section, booking and payment forms, contact information, and a footer. It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements. The hero section includes a prominent image with overlay text. The booking form collects flight details, and the payment form gathers payment information. Contact information visibility can be toggled with a button. This approach provides a comprehensive yet streamlined user experience.
